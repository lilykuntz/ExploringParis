# ExploringParis
A website using HTML and CSS. The first screen is an interactive map of Paris, where you can click on different locations in order to see my own pictures from that location. 
The rest of the pages linked to this website, along with the pictures and the final product can be found at lilykuntz.middcreate.net/finalmap.html
